## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jonathan (Jon) Lane

---

Most folks (professionally) would call me a Quality Engineer. I was a part of the [Harvest](https://github.com/harvesthq) team where I started their QA team, developed their QA process and procedures, and developed a good chunk of the automated testing code behind this popular time tracking application. Today, I work for [Automattic](https://www.automattic.com/) helping out with their QA efforts on the WooCommerce team.

Feel free to reach out at jonathan dot lane at gmail dot com if you need to get in touch with me!
